# CodeLACE: Lightweight Attention-Based Classifier for Efficient Hierarchical Classification

CodeLACE is a novel deep learning model designed for the efficient and accurate hierarchical classification of software requirements and source code. Unlike traditional large transformer models, CodeLACE is optimized for resource-constrained environments, achieving high performance with significantly reduced computational overhead and memory footprint. It leverages a unique architecture that incorporates Sparse Attention, Hierarchical Token Pooling, and a Code-Specific Mixture of Experts to understand and classify code with a deep awareness of its inherent structure and semantics.

## Key Features

*   **Efficiency:** Achieves competitive accuracy with substantially lower training time and memory usage.
*   **Hierarchical Understanding:** Processes code and requirements with an explicit understanding of their hierarchical structure (e.g., tokens, statements, functions, classes).
*   **Adaptive Attention:** Dynamically focuses on relevant code elements, ignoring noise and irrelevant information.
*   **Specialized Processing:** Utilizes a Mixture of Experts to route different types of code constructs to specialized processing units.
*   **Multi-Language Support (Conceptual):** Designed to generalize across various programming languages by focusing on underlying code structures and semantics.


# CodeLACE Project Run Guide

This guide provides comprehensive instructions on how to set up, install dependencies, and run the CodeLACE project. It covers the necessary environment setup and how to execute key components of the project.

## 1. Project Structure Overview

Based on the files you have uploaded to your GitHub repository, here is the current structure of your CodeLACE project:

```
codelace-project/
├── .gitignore            # Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore
├── LICENSE               # Project license information
├── README.md             # Main project README (this guide)
├── Semantic Source Code Analysis.docx # Document related to semantic analysis
├── config.py             # Configuration settings for the model and training
├── evaluation.py         # Scripts for evaluating the model's performance
├── model.py              # Defines the CodeLACE model architecture
├── requirements.txt      # Lists all Python dependencies
├── tokenizer.py          # Handles tokenization and input preparation
├── trainer.py            # Contains the training loop and logic
└── utils.py              # Utility functions
```

## 2. Environment Setup

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies and avoid conflicts with your system-wide Python packages.

### 2.1. Install Python

CodeLACE is developed with Python. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed. You can check your Python version using:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use a package manager like `conda` or `pyenv`.

### 2.2. Create a Virtual Environment

Navigate to your project's root directory (`codelace-project/`) in your terminal and create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### 2.3. Activate the Virtual Environment

**On macOS/Linux:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows (Command Prompt):**

```bash
venc\Scripts\activate.bat
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Your terminal prompt should now show `(venv)` indicating that the virtual environment is active.

## 3. Install Dependencies

With your virtual environment activated, install all required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install libraries such as `torch` (or `tensorflow`), `transformers`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, etc., which are essential for CodeLACE to function.

## 4. Data Preparation (Conceptual)

CodeLACE operates on software requirements or code snippets. You will need to prepare your dataset in a format compatible with the `tokenizer.py` and `trainer.py` scripts. Typically, this involves:

*   **Collecting Data:** Gather your software requirements or code examples.
*   **Preprocessing:** Clean and format your data as needed.
*   **Splitting:** Divide your dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

Refer to specific data loading functions within `trainer.py` or `evaluation.py` for expected data formats.

## 5. Running the CodeLACE Project

### 5.1. Training the Model

To train a new CodeLACE model, you typically run the `trainer.py` script. Before running, you might need to adjust parameters in `config.py` such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and paths to your dataset.

```bash
python trainer.py
```

During training, you would typically save checkpoints and logs. You might need to create `checkpoints/` and `logs/` directories manually if your scripts expect them.

### 5.2. Evaluating the Model

After training, you can evaluate the model's performance using the `evaluation.py` script. Ensure that the script is configured to load the correct model checkpoint.

```bash
python evaluation.py
```

Evaluation results, including metrics and figures, would typically be saved in a `results/` directory. You might need to create this directory manually if your scripts expect it.

## 6. Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When you are done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

This will return your terminal to your system's default Python environment.

**Note:** This guide assumes a standard setup. Depending on your operating system and specific Python environment, minor adjustments to commands might be necessary. If you encounter any issues, refer to the documentation of the respective libraries or Python's official documentation.

## How to Use CodeLACE (Conceptual)

As CodeLACE is a research prototype, its usage involves a typical machine learning model deployment pipeline. Here's a conceptual overview of how you would interact with it:

### 1. Setup (Conceptual)

```bash
# Clone the repository (conceptual)
git clone https://github.com/your-username/codelace.git
cd codelace

# Install dependencies (conceptual - requires a Python environment with PyTorch/TensorFlow and other ML libraries)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Model Loading (Conceptual)

```python
import codelace

# Load a pre-trained CodeLACE model
# Replace 'path/to/your/model.pth' with the actual model file
model = codelace.load_model('path/to/your/model.pth')
model.eval() # Set model to evaluation mode
```

### 3. Prepare Input (Conceptual)

Your input code snippet needs to be provided as a string.

```python
code_snippet = """
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
"""

# Preprocess the code snippet (conceptual tokenization, AST parsing, etc.)
# This step prepares the raw code into a format CodeLACE can understand.
processed_input = codelace.preprocess(code_snippet)
```

### 4. Perform Classification (Conceptual)

Feed the processed input to the CodeLACE model to get the classification output.

```python
# Perform inference
output = model(processed_input)

# The 'output' will be a dictionary or object containing the classification results
# similar to the JSON examples shown above.
print(output)
```

### 5. Interpreting Results (Conceptual)

The output will typically include syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic classifications, along with confidence scores and extracted features, providing a comprehensive understanding of the code snippet.

```python
print(f"Syntactic Type: {output['classification']['syntactic']['type']}")
print(f"Semantic Concept: {output['classification']['semantic']['concept']}")
print(f"Activated Experts: {', '.join(output['extracted_features']['activated_experts'])}")
```

**Note:** The examples and usage instructions provided here are conceptual and illustrative. A functional implementation would require a fully trained CodeLACE model and its associated codebase. This README aims to convey the *capabilities* and *workflow* of CodeLACE.
